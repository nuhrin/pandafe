Pandafe
||||||||||||

Pandafe is a sort of "universal" SDL frontend for Pandora games and emulators. 

It was written especially for the Pandora, with the following goals:
* browse and run all roms and games from a single program
* specify commandline options for each game via a menu
* be fully configurable and extendable via the program itself
* use only dpad and buttons to do all this (no touching, heh)
* persist data via yaml, for human reading/writing/sharing

The out-of-the-box configuration supports:
* Atari Lynx (Handy, mednafen-lynx)
* Gameboy (GnuBoy, mednafen-gb)
* Gameboy Advance (gpSP, mednafen-gba)
* MAME (MAME)
* NeoGeo Pocket (mednafen-ngp)
* NES (gpFCE-GP2X, mednafen-nes)
* Nintendo 64 (Mupen64plus)
* Playstation (PCSX ReARMed)
* Sega 32x (PicoDrive)
* Sega CD (PicoDrive)
* Sega Game Gear (Dega, mednafen-gg)
* Sega Genesis (PicoDrive)
* Sega Master System (Dega, mednafen-sms)
* Super NES (Snes9x4P)
* TurboGrafx-16 (mednafen-pce)
* Wonderswan (mednafen-wswan)

These are the platforms that I enjoy, and those that came easy after 
configuring mednafen. Most any other rom based app should also be workable, 
provided it is capable of accepting a game argument via commandline. 

This is my first SDL program of any kind, and also my first of substance 
written in Vala. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed making it.
No, really. :)


Getting Started
===============

The first time you start Pandafe, you will be presented with the following list:
  * Nintendo/
  * Sega/
  * Other/
  * Pandora >

These are the "platform folders", a configurable grouping of supported 
"platforms." Each platform represents a system with a unique set of games 
(Super NES, Genesis, Pandora, etc).

When you select a platform for the first time you will be prompted to specify 
the path to your roms for that platform. Once this is done you will be able to 
browse and run games of that platform.

When you add or remove roms you will need to rescan the platform or the folder 
you have changed. You can do this via the context menu.

When you add or remove pnds you will need to rescan your pnds. You can do this 
from the main menu, or from the context menu for the "Pandora" platform.


Controls
========

The interface will hopefully feel reasonably intuitive -- just use the game 
controls.

Recognized keys and the action they perform:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  Key    | Browser Action                | Menu Action                        |

| Space  | Show context menu             | Hide context menu (if applicable)  |
| Enter  | Activate selected item        | Activate selected item             |
| Escape | Exit program                  | Return to parent (Cancel)          |
| ,      | Set list item filter          | N/A                                |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
In addition, most lists support alphanumeric keys to cycle through items 
starting with that character.


Platforms and Programs
======================

Platforms define types of games, where they live, and the programs which can 
be used to run them. Programs descibe pnd apps which can run games, and define 
how this is accomplished, including commandline options and a custom command 
where necessary.

Creating new Platforms and Programs, and editing existing ones, is certainly 
something that deserves more discussion and documentation. But, alas, I've 
more than run out of time for this documentation sprint.

Some of you will no doubt have little need for more documentation though, 
and to be honest, you are rather my target audience. :)
