Pandafe
||||||||||||

Pandafe is a sort of "universal" SDL frontend for Pandora games and emulators. 

It was written especially for the Pandora, with the following goals:
* browse and run all roms and games from a single program
* specify commandline options for each game via a menu
* be fully configurable and extendable via the program itself
* use only dpad and buttons to do all this (no touching, heh)
* persist data via yaml, for human reading/writing/sharing

The out-of-the-box configuration supports:
* Arcade (FBA, MAME)
* Atari 2600 (Stella)
* Atari Lynx (Handy, mednafen-lynx)
* Colecovision (Colem)
* Commodore 64 (Vice)
* Gameboy (GnuBoy, Gambatte, mednafen-gb)
* Gameboy Advance (gpSP, mednafen-gba)
* Intellivision (jzintv)
* MSX (openMSX)
* NeoGeo (Gngeo, FBA)
* NeoGeo Pocket (mednafen-ngp)
* NES (GPFCE, gpFCE-GP2X, mednafen-nes)
* Nintendo 64 (Mupen64plus v1/v2)
* Nintendo DS (DraStic)
* Playstation (PCSX ReARMed)
* ScummVM (ScummVM)
* Sega 32x (PicoDrive)
* Sega CD (PicoDrive)
* Sega Game Gear (Dega, mednafen-gg, PicoDrive)
* Sega Genesis (PicoDrive)
* Sega Master System (Dega, mednafen-sms, PicoDrive)
* Super NES (Snes9x4P)
* TurboGrafx-16 (mednafen-pce, Temper)
* Wonderswan (mednafen-wswan)

These are the platforms that I enjoy, those requested, and those that came 
easy after configuring mednafen. Most any other rom based app should also be 
workable, provided it is capable of accepting a game argument via commandline. 

This is my first SDL program of any kind, and also my first of substance 
written in Vala. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed making it.
No, really. :)


Getting Started
===============

The first time you start Pandafe, you will be presented with the following list:
  * Atari >
  * Nintendo >
  * Sega >
  * SNK >
  * Other >
  * Pandora >

These are the default "platform folders", a configurable grouping of supported 
"platforms." Each platform represents a system with a unique set of games 
(Super NES, Genesis, Pandora, etc).

When you select a platform for the first time you will be prompted to specify 
the path to your roms for that platform. Once this is done you will be able to 
browse and run games of that platform.


README! Adding/Changes Games and Apps
=====================================
When you add or remove roms you will need to rescan the platform or the folder 
you have changed. You can do this via the context menu (Space).

When you add or remove pnds you will need to rescan your pnds. You can do this 
from the main menu (Select), or the context menu for the "Pandora" platform.


Game Browser and Views
======================

The main interface is called (by me) the Game Browser. It provides access
to your games through a series of Views. The header indicates the current
view in the upper left, along with some additional information depending on
context. 

Each view presents a list of items which may be either a game or another view
(indicated by " >").  Press B to activate the selected item, which will either 
run that game or change to that view.  Press A to go back to the parent view.
Press Space to bring up a context menu with additional actions and/or 
configuration for the selected item.

The Change View command (L) allows you to quickly switch between different 
types of views: 
* All Games (all games in a single list)
* Favorites (all games marked as such)
* Most Played (all games played, sorted by play count)
* Most Recent (all games played, sorted by play date)
* Category (all games in the category of the selected item)
* Platform (all games in the platform of the selected item)
* Platform List (all available platforms)
* Platform Folders (platform folders view, as configured)

The Change Platform/Category command (R) allows you to quickly switch to a
different platform or category view. Multiple presses will toggle between 
"Change Platform" and "Change Category".


Controls
========

Custimizable controls and in program help have been requested, and hopefully 
I will get the chance to implement those things. For now, please refer to
the following table.

Recognized keys and the action they perform:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  Key    | Game Browser Action           | Menu Action                        |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Up     | Select previous item          | Select previous item               |
| Down   | Select next item              | Select previous item               |
| Left   | Select previous page          | Select previous field value        |
| Right  | Select next page              | Select next field value            |
| Select | Show main menu                | N/A                                |
| A      | Go back to parent             | Return to parent (Cancel)          |
| B      | Activate selected item        | Activate selected item             |
| X      | Select last item              | Select last item / next group      |
| Y      | Select first item             | Select first item / previous group |
| L      | Change view                   | Change view                        |
| R      | Change platform/category      | Change platform/category           |
| Space  | Show context menu             | Hide context menu (if applicable)  |
| Enter  | Activate selected item        | Activate selected item             |
| Escape | Exit program                  | Return to parent (Cancel)          |
| ,      | Set list item filter          | N/A                                |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
In addition, you can use the alphanumeric keys to filter the game list, and 
in menus to cycle through items starting with that character.


Appearance Configuration
========================

Pandafe's appearance can be customized from the Preferences menu. This is 
done through appearance "presets". The idea here is to allow folks to create 
their own notion of pleasant and then share these baked appearance presets 
with each other or submit them for inclusion in later releases. 

Two presets are currently shipped, a new [Default] appearance and the 
previous [Old Default]. These can be copied and modified to create new
appearances.


Game Rom/App Management
=======================

The context menu for games now provides an interface to perform various 
actions on the rom or app representing the game.

For Roms
--------
 * Rename * Change Category * Delete

Changing the category for a rom means moving the file(s) to a folder matching 
the category name within the root rom folder for the platform. If you already
have your roms organized into subfolders within the platform rom folder,
these will be picked up as categories.

If there are multiple files associated with a rom, they will all be renamed/
moved/deleted.  When renaming a .cue file based rom, the contents of the 
que file will be updated as necessary.

Keep in mind that renaming rom files that most emulators associate saves, 
states, etc by filename, so existing saves/etc will most likely no longer 
work unless you rename those files manually. It would be nice if Pandafe 
did this for you automatically, but it doesn't. Maybe later. :)

For Apps
--------
* Rename * Change Category * Edit OVR * Delete PND

Renaming or changing the category for an app means creating/updating the
.ovr file for the app's pnd. This means your changes to apps here will 
apply system wide.

The Edit OVR item allows you to edit all fields supported by .ovr files. 
To return a field to its default, set it to blank.


Platforms and Programs
======================

Platforms define types of games, where they live, and the programs which can 
be used to run them. Programs descibe pnd apps which can run games, and define 
how this is accomplished, including commandline options and a custom command 
where necessary.

Platform and Program definitions can be created and edited via the Data item
on the main menu, or through various context menus. This is certainly something 
that deserves more discussion and documentation, but my time is ever short. :|

Some of you will no doubt have little need for more documentation, and to be 
honest, you are rather my target audience. :) In any case, this forum post
may be helpful to those interested in more information:
